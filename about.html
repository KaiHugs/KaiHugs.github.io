            <h1 class="mark_text">My Platform</h1>
            <p class="lorem_text">My platform revolves around two main objectives that I value strongly at a personal level and I believe is very important towards the environment for Engineering students. 
              In order for Engineering students to succeed effectively it is detrimental to acknowledge and cater towards mental health struggles and our non-traditional learning. 
            </p>

            <p class="lorem_text">1. Mental Health: 
 
              Undoubtedly, engineering is one of the most mentally demanding and challenging majors in university.
              Thus, this can contribute to a unique set of mental health pressure from yourself, your classmates,  parents, professors, etc... 
              It is not abnormal to feel at such high stakes where perfectionism is matched with tight deadlines; this can feel mentally exhausting and bestow 
              feelings of inadequacy or self-doubt. This only briefly acknowledges the aspects of a school setting. Not mentioning the isolation and independence one might feel in a social setting which ruins a support structure from other humans.
               It is hard. It is hard to find a proper work-life balance while managing your own stress, fatigue, and academics. 

               <br><br>
          So what can we do?
<br><br>
Firstly, faculty should be encouraged to increase awareness of healthy and accessible  resources. Examples could include counseling, support groups, and
 crisis intervention resources. It is crucial that these running resources are on flexible hours and scheduling. Emotional support should not be overlooked nor
  stigmatized within the engineering faculty. So, a course that is generalized for all engineering students, should not only academically support students by teaching them how to manage 
  their time and institutional resources, but also promote self-care practices while acknowledging the importance of safe-spaces/seeking help. 
The time used in 2 hour lectures (even during small transition breaks) can be slightly altered to ensure students feel that they are not alone in times of crisis.

               
            </p>

            <p class="lorem_text">2. Pedagogical innovations:
 
              Aspiring engineers have not had a traditional style of learning and thus many foundational concepts are not refined in a manner that would allow a continuation of traditional style teaching. 
              Especially working straight to interactive hands-on applications, it is inherently more difficult for students that have not had even
               2 years of practical experience in this regard. Virtual labs and simulations, although are good resources for practice, are no way of bridging the gap of true material learning. 

               <br><br>
               How can we support future engineers who have had distinctive education?
<br><br>
A form of pedagogical innovation that caters to engineers would be more resources involving interactive exercises, both online and in-class. An education of flipping through online PDFs
 for years to go into industry is a scary forethought especially when lacking certain knowledge sets. I want to ensure that engineering classes are not formed around regurgitating texts from
  pdfs every once a month for the majority of their grades. A first step towards this would be implementing platforms like MyLab for courses that have textbook content to refine the knowledge taught. 
  Furthermore, student education should have a 
special emphasis on collaborative learning in engineering-focused courses. This approach should be especially beneficial to engineering students who have had a physically isolated learning.
